# Exploring Socioeconomic and Demographic Patterns in Suicide Rates (1985-2016)

# Project Overview: Global Suicide Analysis
This project aims to provide insights into the various factors influencing global suicide patterns between 1985 and 2016. By examining these trends across demographics such as age, gender, and economic status, this study enables public health officials and non-governmental organizations with data-driven insights to better customize assistance programs and adjust existing goals. Visualizations and summaries in Power BI provide an accessible approach to understanding patterns and contributing factors in suicide rates, enabling stakeholders to apply these findings to targeted public health initiatives.

# About Author:
The current dataset is a combination of multiple dataset from sources like world health organization, Kaggle, World Bank Group, UNDP. The dataset is complied based on time and region to find any patterns associating with suicide rates based on demographics like age, gender..., countries economic situations.

# Dataset Information:
 The dataset used in this dashboard is available on Kaggle. This dataset includes comprehensive statistics on global suicide rates across various demographics and regions over the period i.e., from 1985 to 2016.

# Key Features:

Yearly Data: Collection of data from 1985 to 2016

Demographics: The Dataset consists of information of age, gender and generation for the entire volume of data. 

Geographical Scope: Data is available across various countries and regions.

# Methodology:
DATA CLEANING

Data cleaning and transformation was performed in the initaial stage of the project. In that stage data type of variables were verified and corrected to their rightfull type,unnecessary columns like country-year were deleted as the data was already available in seperate columns. Missing values were handled by replacing accordingly and the duplicate data was deleted. Query is used to build a categorical column so that we can categorise income level for easier visualizations.

VISUALIZATIONS

Initially for setup a line chart showing the trends of suicide in demographics age group and gender. Aditionally a clustered column chart was created to display the top 10 countries that need help the most and there variation in the count of suicides per 100k population in male and female for deeper understanding. And a stacked column chart was created to display which economic level is involed in suicides. Further slicer for variables gender and generation were included to enhance the analysis and insights.

# Insights:
Gender: Suicides per 100k population are comparatively higher in male than in female.

Country Comparisons: It is observed that suicides per 100k population of male from countries like Russian federation, Lithuania, Hungary and Kazakhstan are comparatively higher than other countries. similarly the suicides in female are higher in countries Korea and Japan.

Income Level: It is evident that countries economy in the range of lower and lower middle income are prone to higher suicide rates.

Generation: Boomer and Silent generations  have higher suicide rates comparatively to other generation and Gen Z has lowest suicide rates.

Time Trend: There is a trend observed where suicide trends have dropped over the years showing a positive impact of suicide prevention methods that are being employed and developed.

Age Group:  The suicide rates are higher between the ages 24-75 years.

# Potential Applications:
1. Targeted Mental Health Programs:

Gender-Specific Initiatives: Develop programs for men in high-risk countries (e.g., Russia, Lithuania) to address cultural stigmas around mental health and encourage open discussions, particularly for at-risk age groups.

Country-Specific Strategies: Tailor initiatives for countries like Korea and Japan (higher female suicide rates) to address unique social pressures within local contexts.

2. Income-Based Support Programs:
Economic Assistance: Design financial and mental health support programs for lower- and lower-middle-income countries where suicide rates are higher, focusing on economically vulnerable areas.

Employment Support and Financial Counseling: Create programs centered on job stability, financial guidance, and economic support to alleviate stressors related to financial insecurity.

3. Generational Programs:
Focused Support for Boomers and Silent Generation: Develop mental health programs that address social isolation, retirement stress, and health issues, and offer digital literacy programs to help older generations access mental health resources.

Youth-Oriented Prevention Programs: Build resilience and coping mechanisms for Gen Z, even with lower rates, to sustain or further reduce suicide rates in younger generations.
Strengthening 

4. Age-Specific Suicide Prevention:

Age-Based Outreach: Target resources for individuals aged 24â€“75 by focusing on life transitions such as career pressures, family responsibilities, and age-related health concerns.

5. Improving and Scaling Current Prevention Methods:

Expansion of Proven Strategies: Reinforce effective practices like crisis intervention hotlines, school counseling, and community mental health campaigns to sustain the observed decrease in suicide rates over time.

Policy Support for Mental Health: Encourage policies for mandatory mental health education, accessible counseling services, and regular mental health checkups in countries with high suicide rates.

6. Global Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:

Cross-Country Collaborations: Facilitate international collaborations to share successful prevention methods, enabling high-risk countries to learn from those with decreasing suicide trends.

Research and Monitoring: Invest in research for high-risk areas and vulnerable demographics (e.g., Boomers and Silent Generation) to refine targeted interventions and monitor their impact.
